1. What is Data:
  --> Data is unanalized, unorganized, unrelated materials. 
  --> It is an individual unit which conatins raw material and dose not cary any meaning.
  --> it is measured in bits and bytes.
  --> Data is a raw material.


2. What is information:
  --> Information is the protect and group of data which collectively carry a logical meaning.
  --> Information is measured in meaningful units like time, quantity.


3. What is Data Modeling:
  1. Modeling is Structure.
  2. Data Model is the modeling of the data description, data semantics, and consistency  
     constraints of the data.
 
  3. It provides the conceptual tools for describing the design of a database 
     at each level of data abstraction. 

4. What is Entity Realationship Model (ER Model):
   1. Entity is real world Object like person, student.
   2. Imtiyaz works for human --> isme works ek Realationship hai
   3. Attributs? student ke Attributs --> student ka roll No, Name, age they all are Attributs 

   --> Types of Entity:
       1. Entity Types.
       2. Entity Sets.

       1. Entity Types:
          Entity types is a collection of entities or Object with similar attributs.
          student => Entity Name + id, age, Name, gender <-- attributs they all are say Entity ty 
      
       2. Entity Sets: Suppose ek college mein all student ka data hai uss data Table bahut sare 
          Students hai sab student ke ek row mein different Data hai Like Students1, student2 they all called Entity Sets.

          Entity set is collection of the Object to same entity.

          Exapmle: Student1 --> Name , Age, gender id, address
                   student2 --> Name , Age, gender id, address
                   Student3 --> Name , Age, gender id, address

5. What is Attributs:
   An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. 
   An entity may contain any number of attributes.

   1. Types of Attributs:
      1. Simple or Atomic Vs Composite.
      2. Single Valued vs Multi Valued.
      3. Stored Vs derived.
      4. Complex Attributs.
      5. Key Attributs.

      1. Simple or Atomic Vs Composite: 
         Simple attributs are those attributs jise hum dubara hum divide nhi kar sakte like Gender and Like student ka grades {A, B, C, D, E, F} ise hum no agina divide.

         Composite attributs:
         Composite attributs are those attributs jise hum again divide kar saktey hai like Student ka Name --> First Name, Middle Name and Last Name nad other Exampa
         address ---> House No. , Street, Area , Pin Code


      2. Single Valued vs Multi Valued   
         1. Single Valued: Single Valued attributs have single Value Like Phone Number
         2. Multi Value: Multi Value attributs have multiple value Like address 
            Ek Employee ke pass mutltiple houses Ho saktey hai they Multi value Attributs.
     

      3. Stored Vs derived.
         1. Store Attributs: Like ek table mein student ka DOB store ---> 24 Jan 2001
         2. Derived Attributs: we can find data through other attributs like age from other.

      4. Null Attributs:
         Null attribute are those attribute those have no any entity like ek student but uska koee address nhi hai toh uske value ki jagah Null store kar dengey DataBase mein .


       5. Complex Attributs:
          Complex attribute are those attribute they mutltiple key attribute and they multiple address have mutltiple phone Number.

          Exapmle: address {(Building No, Pin code, {phone Number} }
       

       6. Key Attributs:
          key attribute are those attribute jise hum uniquely identify kar saktey hai 
          Exapmle: Suppose ek student table

                    <---------> Student <---------->

                    Roll No| Name | Gender | address
                    123        A     M        Delhi
                    23         B     F        Noida
                    45         C     M        Bihar

                    --> we can access student uniquely by their on the basis of Roll Number.
                    --> unique attribute Dublicates nhi ho sakti kisi bhi row uniquely
                    --> Best Exapmle of Key Attributs: Aadhaar card 



6. What is Realationship:
   1. Degree
      --> Binary
      --> Ternary
      --> N-ary
    
   2. Cardinarity Ratio: 


<===========================> Relatonal Model (RDBMS) <==============================>

1.RDBMS ki modeling mein Relatonal Model use hoti hai


2. Types of DBMS(Databse):
   1. Relatonal Databse:  they all Relatonal database
   2. Non-Relatonal Databse: MongoDB,

   1. Relatonal Databse:
      Relatonal Database are those database which are store in the form of Table (Row, Column) 
      For Exapmle of Relatonal Databse are MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
   
   2. Non-Relatonal Databse:
      Non-Relatonal Database are those database which are store in the form of Docs or XML 
      For Exapmle of Non-Relatonal Databse are MongpDB, Exist DB etc


3. Schema based constraints:
   1. Domain constraints.
   2. Null constraints.
   3. key constraints.

   1. Domain constraints:
      each attribute value should be atomic and belongs to attribute domain sets 1. Data Types
      2. Range [1- 100]  3. List [5, 10, 20, 40]
   

   2. Null attribute:
      It specifies whether null value are permitted or not



==> What is SQL:
    SQL Stands for Structural Query Language.

==> What is Procedural Language?
==> What is Non-Procedural language or Declarative Language?

==> What is difference Between Procedural and Non-Procedural Language
   1. Procedural Language:
      User has to tell both what and How to do it Ex: C, C++, Java etc.
      Best Example Tea banane ke liye Mom ko boltey goto on Kicten take sugar something ...
   
   2. Non-Procedural Language:
      users has to tell what to do and need not worry about how to do it Ex: SQL, LISP etc 
     
   --> SQL is absed on the concepts of Set Theory.


==> What is Database:
    Database Just Like Hard disk jsime Mera all data Store Rahta hai like Movie, image, music etc

==> What is DBMS(Database Mannagement System):
    DBMS ek software hota hai jiske jariye hum apne Data ko access kar saktey hai.
    and by the help of DBMS hum Database ke under read, write, delete anything we can do.


    Best Example Mera Laptop hai and laptop ke under Hard Disk pari huee hai and  i want to access Data from hard disk toh mere mere laptop ke under operating stystem hai jsika mai use karke hard ko use kar pa raha hu
    

    DBMS ek software Hota hai jisse hum apne Database ko access kar saktey hai like read, write


==> SQL Schema:
   1. It is identified by a Schema name and it includes an authorizaton indentifiers to identify the user or account who owns the schema as well as discripes for the each element.

   2. Schema element could include tables, types, constraints, views, domain, indexs etc.

   3. we can create a schema using below commands:
      create schema sche-name authorizaton user-name

      create schema company authorization postgres;

      --> uper ki command se ek schema create kiya hu and mai postgres name ke user only access diya hu only ye sirf access kar sakta hai.

   

==> Ctalog:
    catalog mein bhi Table store rahata hai and usme ye information hoti hai koun sa data kahan par store hai 
    

    1. catalog mein meta data store rahta hai.
    2. catalog is container of schema.
    3. when database is installed , default enviroment & schema is created, so that when a user login he/she can directly refers to tables & other elemnts withouts having to the specify a particular schema name public.



==> Information Schema:
    A catalog always conatins a special schema called information schema which provides information on all the schema in the catalog & all element describing in them

 ==> schema means hota hai ki table + table ke under uska attribute, views, constraints, like foreign key constraints, super key constraints etc.   
 
==> How to set newly craeted schema to use?
    Command: SET search_path TO schema_name.
             schema-name means table ka name like

--> Schema means Structure hota.
--> Tuple means entire row.

===> SQL Features;
     1. DDL (Data Defintion Language).
     2. DML (Data manipulation language).

     1. Data Defintion Language(DDL):
        DDL deals with schema and and you want ki aap table ke under new attribute add karna chahtey ho koee data store karna chahte ho 
        
        . CREATE
        . ALTER
        . DROP
        . TRUNCATE

        . CREATE:
          CREATE Command ka use kartey hai for creating the Table

        . ALTER:
          ALTER DDL command ka Basically use hum tab kartey jab 2 Table crated kar rahe hai
          and hum chahtey hai ki constraints baad mein add kru then we should be use ALTER com..

          ALTER command is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
          ALTER command is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.


         Alter command: alter table students alter column age type varchar(10)

        . DROP:
          Drop command are use to check if table alreday excits then they delete Like ta student 
          command: drop table if excits student

            
          Example of drop Command:
                     
            drop table if exists students;
            drop table if exists course cascade;

            select * from information_schema.referential_constraints where constraint_schema ='company';

            create table course(
               s_course_id numeric primary key,
               s_course_name varchar(20)
               
            );


            create table students(
               sid numeric, 
               sname varchar(30),
               s_course_id numeric references course(s_course_id)
            );


             
          
         . TRUNCATE
           delete all the values inside the table without altering or deleting schema of the table

           . Command: truncate table table_name

           Example of truncate command

               drop table if exists students;
               drop table if exists course cascade;

               select * from information_schema.referential_constraints where constraint_schema ='company';

               create table course(
                  s_course_id numeric primary key,
                  s_course_name varchar(20)
                  
               );


               create table students(
                  sid numeric, 
                  sname varchar(30),
                  s_course_id numeric references course(s_course_id)
               );


               insert into students values(1,'DBMS');
               insert into students values(2,'DBMS');
               insert into students values(3,'DBMS');
               insert into students values(4,'DBMS');
               insert into students values(5,'DBMS');

               truncate table students ;

               select * from students;



<---------------------------------> <------------------------------------------->

---> DDL Command for creating Table Example:
     
     create table table_name(
         attribute1_name datatype,
         attribute2_name datatype,
         attribute2_name datatype,
     );
     
     create table Employee(
      Fname varchar(15)  <-- menas char ka length 15 rahega condition
      Mname varchar(16), <-- same condition
      Lname varchar(16), <-- same condition
      SSN char(9),
      Bdate date,
      address varchar(50);
      sex char,
      salary numeric,
      superssn char(90),
      dno numeric
     );

<--------------------------------------> <-------------------------------------->


     2. Data manipulation language(DML);
        DML deals with Data inside Tables.
        Playing with value then we use DML.

        . SELECT
        . DELETE
        . INSERT
        . UPDATE


        . DELETE command:
          delete command are use to remove the tuples from a relation

          Syntax:
          delete from table_name where column_name condition value.
          Exmple:

         drop table if exists students;
         drop table if exists course cascade;

         select * from information_schema.referential_constraints where constraint_schema ='company';

         create table course(
            s_course_id numeric primary key,
            s_course_name varchar(20)
            
         );


         create table students(
            sid numeric, 
            sname varchar(30),
            s_course_id numeric references course(s_course_id)
         );


         insert into course values(1,'DBMS');
         insert into course values(2,'DBMS');
         insert into course values(3,'DBMS');
         insert into course values(4,'DBMS');
         insert into course values(5,'DBMS');


         select * from course;

         delete from course where s_course_id %2 = 0


      
      3. Defining views on the database.
      
      4. we can provide security and authorization means koun user acces kar skata hai and kiss 
         way mein acces kar sakta  hai. one row or one column ka access de saktey special
      



===> Data Types in SQL:
1. Numeric
   1. Integer Types(Noraml int, Bight int, ....)
   2. Floating point Types
   3. Serial Types
   4. Arbitary precision Numbers

2. character:
   1. character varying(n), varchar(n)	variable-length with limit
   2.character(n), char(n)	fixed-length, blank padded
   3.text	variable unlimited length


3. Boolean
   1. true 
   2. flase
   3. unkonwn (Ex: 12>Null ouput --> unkonwn 2nd Null == Null --> unkonwn)


4. Date:
   YYYY-MM-DD

5. Time:  
   HH.MM.SS 

6. TimeStamp : 
    TimeStamp mein date and Time dono include ho jatey hai
    Ex: "2:3:23 12:20:60"


7. Inteval:



==> What are views:
    . This is Virtual Table
    . It Stores a query

    1. Types of views
       . Read only / updatable views
       . Materialized views
    
    2. Uses of views
       . To provide different views of samee data
       . To restrict data acces
       . complex queries can be stored in form of views

---> SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
---> Basically constraints are just rules for table like name not be null means not be balank
===> Constraints in SQL:
     1. not null
     2. default
     3. check
     4. unique
     5. primary key
     6. foreign key

     1. not null:
        not null is constraints whcih tell value not be null menas koee table craete huwa and uss table ke colum mein value null nahi hona chahiye
     
     2. default: 
        If hum kisi attribute mein value store nhi karte hai toh uss attribute mei by default null value store ho jati hai by default simple.

    3. check constraints:
       check constraints ka hum log use kartey jab koee restriction lagani ho Suppose aapne ATM mein gye and 10k withdrawal nikalne ki kosis ki and aapke account mein 8k hi balance hai 
       then balance withdrawal nhi honi chahiye.

       Then hum Database mein constraints laga saktey hai ki command--> check(withdrawal>C.B)

   
   4. unique Constraints:
      Maine kisi Column ko unique specify kar diya and mai koee value again insert karne ki kosis
      kar raha hu then database ek error through karega unique constraints voilet

      . unique constraints mein NULL Value bhi Store Kar saktey hai


   5. primary key constraints:
      . primary key constraints is combination of UNIQUE + NOT NULL means.
      . ek table ke column mein value should be unique as well as not null. 
      . If kisi column mein value null Insert kar rahe hai then database ek error through karega 
        not null voilet.

   6. Foreign Key constraints:
      . Foreign key constraints is combination of two Relatonal(TABLE)
        means they Eshtablish Realation Between two Table
      
      . suppose koee new employe hai hai and usse abhi filhal koee dapartment allowcate nhi huee 
        hai toh filhal ke liye usse Null Department mein allowcate kar dengey


       ---> V.V.I 
       . Foreign key allow you tostore duplicates value means same employe they can work same dep
       . Foreign key constraints allow to store NULL Value
       . Foreign key constraints ka DATA TYPE same hona chahiye

       . Suppose we have two Table First Employee Table and second is Department table and iss   
         dono table mein kuchh attribute hai empl ID, Empl Name, Deprt No. same as in Department table then (i) Data Type must be same (ii) D.No. must be primary key



====> Best Example of Foreign key constraints:

drop table if exists students;
drop table if exists gradeT;

create table gradeT (
   gname char,
   gid numeric,
   primary key(gname)
);


create table students(
   imt numeric,
   sname varchar(30),
   grade char,
   foreign key (grade) references gradeT(gname) on delete set null
);


insert into gradeT values('A',1);
insert into gradeT values('B',2);
insert into gradeT values('C',3);


insert into students values(1, 'abc', 'A');
insert into students values(2, 'def', 'B');
insert into students values(2, 'ghi', 'C');


select * from students;
select * from gradet;

delete from gradeT where gid = 2;



===> Insert and Delete Operation 

drop table if exists students;
drop table if exists gradeT;

create table gradeT (
   gname char,
   gid numeric,
   primary key(gname)
);


create table students(
   imt numeric,
   sname varchar(30),
   grade char,
   foreign key (grade) references gradeT(gname)
);


insert into gradeT values('A',1);
insert into gradeT values('B',2);
insert into gradeT values('C',3);


insert into students values(1, 'abc', 'A');
insert into students values(2, 'def', 'B');
insert into students values(2, 'ghi', 'C');


select * from students;
select * from gradet;

delete from students where sname = 'abc';
delete from gradet where gid = 2;
